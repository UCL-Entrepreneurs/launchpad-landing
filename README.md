#Moonshot Launchpad Landing Page

On the contrast of its name, this is a website design specially dedicated to our `Moonshot Launchpad` programme. 

Recommended:
- The director of marketing (or the coder of marketing team) is the only one who can push to master while the other contributor should create a new branch.
- The Master coder then review the code and decides the cleanliness and the functionality of the code before being pushed to master
- This repository's master branch will automatically updates our current website, [launchpad.ucle.co] (http://launchpad.ucle.co/) as a result of modifying the CNAME and the Alias of the website itself.


Happy Coding
